Second year project called Project Game Development (PGD)
Contributers are : Bowen Schlahmilch, Beau Wijkstra, Nicolaas Schuddeboom and I, Quintin Yu

You play as a hero that can switch classes at any given time. This will give you both the weaknesses and the strenghts of those classes. The classes work in a rock-paper-scissors
type mechanic. Warrior > Archer > Mage > Warrior

You start with 3 base levels in which you can learn each class. In the last level you siege a castle while switching between classes to get the most effective out come possible.
